        <p>Hey! My name is Cayden. For work I am a Product Test Engineer and Developer. I enjoy photography
            and seeing how far I can take dirt roads before they end in my Jeep. I enjoy writing code in C# and
            have been working on a program which automatically documents C# code into a markdown file when you
            commit your changes to a git repository. I do a lot of work with weather stations and renewable
            energy for work. I particularly enjoy working with any sort of solar sensor. I have built a solar
            tracker which can fit a full size solar panel from scratch. This has allowed me to greatly improve
            my testing capabilities at work by being able to directly point sensors at the sun which allows me to
            test for longer periods each day.
        </p>

        <p>Utah is a beautiful state full of nature and wildlife. You can see everything from desert, to snow capped
            mountains, and everything in between. Utah is known for its 5 national parks including Zion, Arches,
            Canyonlands, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef. Utah was admitted into the Union on January 4th 1896 making it the
            45th state. Preceding this, the Pioneers reached and settled utah in 1847.</p>
